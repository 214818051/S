                    <h4>Quality Publishing</h4>
                    <p>  Young African emerging writers of various ages and areas are a major focus of ours. This is not to say that other age groups will not be considered; we are all open to a variety of submissions. With the advancement of technology, we offer you the opportunity to see your words in print through digital distribution, which is done through online distribution whereby your book can be accessed online at major stores such as Amazon, Takealot.com, Google Books, Barnes & Nobles, Kindle Direct Publishing, and much more other available. Our project timeline ranges from 35 to 90 days, allowing you to receive your book within the specified time frame after approval. Because of the nature of our team-building strategy, this is possible.

It's heartbreaking to see your work rejected by a potential publisher after years or days of hard work and sleepless nights when all you wanted was to see your words in print and reap the benefits, spread the message, and add value to the book's development. There is no chance of your work being rejected by us, which is why we offer you a publishing consultation in which you will be given a fair chance to be given guidance on making sure your book reaches its target. It is our responsibility as writers to make you happy. You do not need to be concerned about any delays because we are collaborating with experienced freelancers.</p>
